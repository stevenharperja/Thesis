# Pre-meeting:

- Plan to use bitnet and use it to make sentences for flash card vocab, or to generate questions about reading material, all on the user's local machine
- Pros: runs off of wifi, more privacy
- Cons: worser text generation, but probably not that bad.
    -   From the github, generation seems:
        -   fine on the sentence level
        -   okay at the paragraph level
        -   bad at the essay level
        so it might do well enough.

# During meeting:
###
Instead could have the phone connect to a llm server once a day to update the flashcards, or to update and get questions for the user to answer


### PRoblems with flashcards

passive use (not doing, just reading)
Using them as the only tool
memorization instead of context
See more online problems and opinions people have, eg. youtube or reddit.
Capture the pros of flashcards, address some of the cons
contextual, scenario based

### address example scenarios when designing the program
Look up examples from what people struggle with travelling to japan with little language knowledge
English is a hard example for me to use because I've never struggled with it, but jp would be good because I have.
"Whats the hardest thing about learning X language?" What are elements that come up with Japanese that my program could address?
"Whats the easier things?"
^ these will help you narrow down abilities of program
context, vocab, grammar, symbols, etc.

Look at how the US Govt. (State Dept.) trains people in languages for the contexts they needed. See the image he sent


Thesis isn't meant to be a product, not viable, not valuable, just show that I addressed a problem.

System can be tailored to reducing common errors people have (Eg something that causes people to get mad, critical mistakes)(eg a hard word)
    -   Advanced classes or advanced books (C2) could go over some of these.
        -   Dolly?



Focus on difficulties in language learning using flashcards
If I limit it to flash cards, non-interactive, text-based, I can still get a lot done.

Look up "Top 10 mistakes" "Top words that people confuse" etc. for Japanese for native eng
even top 100 could be good, though the later ones down the list might not come up often.

Email Tappan with any progress or if I get lost
