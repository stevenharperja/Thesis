I feel lost
# During meeting
- Trainstation example
    - need to look into this
    - Doesn't need to just be trainstation stuff, can pick any topic, even compsci words or somthing idk.

- What would ml be helpful for with technical topics <- stuff which isn't as well documented.
    - laymen's language, workman's language, etc.
    - eg diff types of words for create in "create a java class"
        -   instantiate vs create, etc.
            -   connotations of those words.
            -   free of misleading implications.
    
- Context for anki cards would be useful for in advance before you've been properly exposed to the topic irl.
    -   addressing a specific problem like the technical topic could work. or for the train situation
        -   CS stuff could be an example 

- finding a location to mine data would be good. chatgpt has it, idk ask chatgpt smth, mine the results.
    -   could have a system prompt chatgpt, make sense of it, 
        -   

- Can look into research about how to properly use chatgpt in general in education. Rather than banning it, what do people do?

- Could ask that jp guy who uses chapy alot about his experience
- Play with it, pretend to be like what I want my system to be.
    -   Can address the specific problem.
        -   "how do I sound like a professional compsci p in japanese"
            -   This would give me a guidance of values that an index card ought to follow. (similar to themes guiding a dnd plan)

- prompt: "Is there a book that would help me learn how to communicate about computer science in Japanese?"
    - answer was basically "read"
    - In my project, I'm trying to do this differently.
    - ->"Are there any shortcuts"
        -   "learn the style of japanese CS."
        -   "memorize 30 core (common) sentence structures found here"
        -   API docs, dev sites, mix and match data.
        -   

prompt chatgpt to figure out my thesis and explore data source ideas.

Its vague but go into these ideas, expand on them, find data, etc.

me ideas:
~~~
for the tourist example, mine their data, and try the flashcard context thing.
for the cs example, mine data, and try the flashcard context thing. (feed into the program i mean)
tappan answer:
not making any claims of doing something better (hard to prove) instead just say its a way to do it (learning better). doesn't have to be new, doesn't have
dont have to evaluate it. more like a youtube anecdotal video in level of rigourousness.

doesnt have to be cs as example problem, as long as its a little technical 
could be specific like web dev specifically. (maybe i could do data science?)
could look up "top 100 words or phrases in that topic by frequency"


interesting things that might come up during dev is that chapy might not give an on topic answer, how deal with that?

for free version of chappy, can play around.
    -   Have a converstation wtih chappy to see what options it would give you as if it were a tutor, and you're asking it for help with "how to communicate as a prof in japanese"
        -   Native japanese speakers not gonna give a lot of good if they dont know CS.
            -   This can be a tool beyond a tutor's capabilities.
        -   get a feel for what you and chappy are doing, make notes about it, figure out how you prompted to get to a good result when you get a favorable result.
            -   Figure out how do "I" do this, then figure out how to get a program here to do what I'm doing. 
            -   Its a bit like how in the past when search engines first came out, people had to learn how to query a search engine usefully.
            -   Prompt engineering, advanced prompt engineering
                -   "how do I write questions, so that it can lead me to the answer?"
kind of doing a semi-automated chatgpt interaction system. for thematically focused japanese contexts

record what im doing to get better at prompting chatgpt to 

doesnt have to be chatgpt, could have multiple tools. Gemini etc. Try the same prompts, or similar prompts to start exploring how to prompt well.
- eg translators
    - some products are better at different things
        - pro/s and const could try to take the different bests of each of them and synthesize it?
            -   averaging them.
- the llms won't be the same

- show that there is a problem and that it helps get u around the problem.
- my program can just be an automation of the tedius prompting.

have done by next sprint:
- prompting to get a favorable answer, notes on how to get that favorable answer through prompting.//do this and report back to tappan.
    -   positive and negative results are both good.
        -   gives u information on how you want to implement it, or how you want to not implement it.
- figure out how i couold make a system to do that. //not yet

chappy said with cs jp topic, knowing what not to do can be good too.

class starts on the 6th

meeting sometime next week
email by/on monday of that week for when to meet.
