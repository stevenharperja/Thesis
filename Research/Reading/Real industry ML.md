                Experience building ML-driven mobile applications in domains requiring user personalization, privacy, or security.
                Understanding of real-time data processing and behavioral modeling on resource-constrained edge devices.
                Knowledge of on-device learning techniques, federated learning, or personalization methods.
                Prior contributions to systems using federated learning, differential privacy, or local fine-tuning of models is a plus
                Experience with backend infrastructure for model management (e.g., model registries, update orchestration, logging frameworks) is a plus.
                Prior work with anomaly detection or behavioral modeling in resource-constrained environments is a plus.
                Experience developing responsive systems capable of monitoring local context and dynamically triggering actions based on model outputs is a plus
                Experience optimizing models for ARM architectures is a plus
