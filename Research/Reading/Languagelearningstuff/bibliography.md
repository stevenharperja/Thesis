### ANKI AND LLMS
- Anki LLM import/export https://github.com/raine/anki-llm
    -   Looks like it has lots of documentation https://deepwiki.com/raine/anki-llm/2-getting-started 
    -  //Maybe see if I can access the date of the card with this?
- Anki card creation using LLM https://alexledger.substack.com/p/doing-cool-things-with-flashcards
    - https://github.com/aled1027/llm-tools-anki
    - For images, and variation, etc.

    -   Thoughts:
        -   Can I expand on the idea they did here? Is there a code base for it? Why didn't it work out? what happened?
        -   Could I make a full SRS software which recommends flashcards while also handling the flashcard aspect of things? is that too much to do?
