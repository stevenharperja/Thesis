it would be pretty cool to pipe the day's scheduled flashcards into an LLM before going through the cards. Ask it to make the best sentence it can out of all of the words, that way you get some reading material to link it to before/after you do your flashcards.
-   It just about works https://chatgpt.com/share/69316b62-6164-8007-bb0a-5c9b2505a381
What if instead of trying to make one big sentence, you tried to make a sentence for each word piped diri incorporate 1-2 other words

It looks like there is already a good amount of coverage for making flash cards for LLMs

Instead focus on that one idea of basket analysis for flashcard recommendation maybe? I don't think that has been explored much judging from a quick search result.
piping that directly into a dictionary could be good. as like "related words"
- this exists: https://relatedwords.org/


Could it be possible to compare a list of "known words" and a passage of text and select all the ones that aren't in the text, then have the llm make flashcards? actually that could just be done with traditional methods for the most part.




#### AAAA I WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH MODEL COMPRESSION DAMMIT.
- Requirements:
MS with published research work in ML model optimization, post-training quantization, consideration of different datasets and different constrains (bit-accuracy, model size, latency and so on)
    Experience with popular ML frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow
