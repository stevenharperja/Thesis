on device machine learning applications


Maybe just do on-device thing?
https://medium.com/@gautsoni/on-device-llms-what-they-are-why-they-matter-and-how-to-ship-them-2b99f0bd6078 Pretty good chappy-written article


Maybe I could still do the language flashcards, as phrases.
- Store a "must include" word
Have it write a short sentence including the word.
That's it!
Plug it into Anki.
Run this thing once a day.
Is it a good solution? kinda.
Is it a bad solution? no.
it has uses.
Making it offline may be overkill but I wanna do it that way.

"Named Entity Recognition" Might apply here.


Architecture approach to get all my frameworks:
Jax?
LoRA?
