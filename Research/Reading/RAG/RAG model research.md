- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-D1OfcDW1M Short RAG tutorial 
    -   Data can be open like internet, or could be closed like company private data
    -   Making a good data retriever is also an worked on problem
    -   & Generative part
    -   The data is added to the context somehow. (as vector probably?)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzssm02u35I Code to use one.
- https://www.langchain.com/langgraph Lang  from Bojian's email suggestions "Langchain/Langraph also provides well accepted open source lib/framework for RAG dev. "

        -   Part 2. Indexing
            -   Documents are converted to numbers
                -   Methods:
                    -   Bag of words (frequency)
                    -   Model embeddings //used in the tutorial, theres an OpenAIEmbeddings package.
                        -   Vector search afterwards

                            -   I love this topic its easily approachable because of past experience.

        -   5 Query translation multi query
            -   using an LLM to change user question to improve retrieval.
                - Can do it multiple times and combine the search results
        -   6 Query translation RAG Fusion
            -   it ranks the returned queries somehow?

    -   Bert model is good for embeddings
