reminds of pseudoinverse of a matrix.
can get low rank approx. of matrices using pseudoinverses.

eccart young thm. for svd

steve brunton has videos on the topic. check svd to refresh self on topic
and also eccart young thm just says best low rank approx. is obtained by keeping the leading singular values.

other ways people choose the leading k values:
optimal k based on how much error and such. there are for loop algorithms for it.



flowfields would be cool for a wind game.
