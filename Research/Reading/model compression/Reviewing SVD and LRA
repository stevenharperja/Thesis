    - The columns of U are related to the varience of columns of the orignal matrix A.
    - U and V are unitary; orthonormal columns each of unit length
    - V^T's columns (so the rows of V) would give the mixture of all of the columns of U@Sigma which add up to the corresponding (from V) column of X.
